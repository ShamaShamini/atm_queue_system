### ATM Queue System Simulation
This project simulates the performance of an ATM queue system, evaluating how different configurations (e.g., number of ATMs, customer arrival rates, and service times) affect wait times, queue length, and system efficiency.
#### Features
Simulates ATM queues with varying conditions.
Tracks metrics: Average wait time, Peak wait time, and Queue length.
Visualizes results with plots (e.g., line plots and bar charts).
##### Requirements
Python 3.80 or above 
Libraries: matplotlib, numpy, pandas
Install dependencies:
## pip install matplotlib numpy pandas
### Usage
Clone or download the project.
Run the simulation:
Sample :
 ###  python atm_queue_simulation.py
View results in the console and plots for visual analysis.
### Scenarios
Number of ATMs: Simulate the impact of adding more ATMs on wait times.
Customer Arrival Rate: Analyze how different arrival rates (low, medium, high) affect wait times.
Service Time: Evaluate the impact of longer service times on system efficiency.
### Improvements
Add more ATMs during peak hours.
Optimize service time via faster card reading and automated processes
Implement dynamic queue management to prioritize urgent transactions.
